# Week 16 - Project Suggestions

### General Suggestions

Your project _should_:

* Incorporate Basic Testing Framework

* Use Handlebars for Server-Side Templating

* Incorporate Authentication (JSON Web Tokens, Sessions, Etc.)

* Use an existing public dataset to power the database

* Create a migration strategy for sharing data across team members.

### Testing Suggestions

* Set up Karma so you can run your tests as you develop.

* Prior to implementing a feature, use Nightmare to write a functional test for it.

* Prior to implementing a function, use Mocha and Chai to write unit tests against it.

* Run your tests prior to committing your code so you can be sure nothing breaks between commits.

* **Non-Obligatory Bonus**: If you're confident and feel like you have some time to tinker, set up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). This will automatically run your tests whenever you or any of your team members makes a commit.
